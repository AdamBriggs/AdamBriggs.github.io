Hiya! I'm Adam and this is where I post thoughts about my professional life. I'm currently an optical engineering undergraduate at the Institute of Optics. As a lens designer, my goal is to merge the divide between science and design.

Feel free to look around. Hopefully you will find something interesting. If you are in Rochester, please reach out if you want a tour or to chat.
